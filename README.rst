**An experimental Open edX plugin for AI-powered educational workflows**

The AI Extensibility Framework is a proof-of-concept plugin that explores artificial intelligence integration in the Open edX platform. It provides a modular, extensible architecture for building AI-powered workflows that enhance the learning experience.

Overview
********

This plugin demonstrates how AI capabilities can be integrated into Open edX in a modular and extensible way, following the principle of "open for extension, closed for modification." It provides infrastructure for AI workflows while maintaining compliance with educational requirements and Open edX standards.


Current Status
**************

.. warning::
   **Experimental** - This plugin is in active development and should not be used in production environments.

This is an exploratory project developed by edunext as part of FC-111 to investigate AI extensibility patterns for the Open edX platform. The plugin serves as a testing ground for AI integration concepts that may inform future development.

**What Works:**

- Frontend integration with Learning MFE and Authoring MFE via plugin slots
- Basic content extraction from course unit
- AI-powered content summarization
- Modular workflow-based architecture for AI processing
- Support for multiple LLM providers via LiteLLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Context-aware AI assistance examples integrated into the learning experience
- Observable workflows with event analytics in aspects
- Configuration-driven behavior without code changes

**Documentation**

Documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-ai-extensions/en/latest/index.html>`_.


Installation
************

Prerequisites
=============

- Open edX installation (Tutor-based deployment recommended)
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js 18.x or higher (for frontend development)
- API key for supported LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Installation
============

Install the plugin in your Open edX environment using the provided tutor plugin::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openedx/openedx-ai-extensions.git
    tutor plugins enable openedx-ai-extensions
    tutor images build openedx
    tutor images build mfe
    tutor local launch



Getting Started
===============

After installation, you need to configure the plugin with your AI provider and set up workflows. The configuration involves:

1. **Provider Setup**: Configure authentication and model routing for your chosen AI service
2. **Scope Configuration**: Define where AI workflows will be available (courses, locations)
3. **Profile Configuration**: Define what the AI will do and what information it will access

For detailed configuration instructions, see the `Configuration Guide <docs/quickstarts/configuration_guide.rst>`_.

Quick Configuration Example
----------------------------

Add to your Tutor ``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   AI_EXTENSIONS:
     openai:
       API_KEY: "sk-proj-your-api-key"
       MODEL: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

   PLUGINS:
     - openedx-ai-extensions

Then configure scopes and profiles in the Django admin at ``/admin/openedx_ai_extensions/``.

Usage
=====



Setting Up Development Environment
===================================

For automated or non-interactive environments, configure the plugin via Tutor's ``config.yml`` and build the images.

1. **Configure the Extension**:
   Add the repository and AI provider settings to your Tutor ``config.yml``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      AI_EXTENSIONS:
        <your-config-name>:
          API_KEY: "your-api-key"
          MODEL: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

2. **Enable and Build**:
   Enable the plugin and rebuild the Open edX images to bake in the dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor plugins enable openedx-ai-extensions
      tutor images build openedx
      tutor dev launch

3. **Initialize Database**:
   Run migrations as a one-time setup step:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tutor dev exec lms python manage.py lms migrate openedx_ai_extensions

Loading Demo Fixtures
---------------------

A set of demo fixtures is included to quickly populate the database with example
AI workflow profiles and scopes. These cover several common configurations:
flashcards, box chat with summary, chat with function calling, streaming chat,
educator assistant, and mocked streaming.

Load them with::

    tutor dev exec lms python manage.py lms loaddata demo_profiles

.. important::

   The fixtures do **not** include inline API keys — they rely on the global
   provider configuration in your Tutor ``config.yml`` (the ``AI_EXTENSIONS``
   block). Make sure you have configured at least one provider with a valid key
   before using the profiles that call a real LLM.

   If you need a per-profile API key override instead, edit the profile's
   ``content_patch`` in the Django admin and add an ``options`` block::

       "processor_config": {
         "LLMProcessor": {
           "options": {
             "API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
           },
         },
       }


Code Standards
==============

- All code, comments, and documentation must be in clear, concise English
- Write descriptive commit messages using conventional commits.
- Follow the CI instructions on code quality.


Architecture Decisions
======================

Significant architectural decisions are documented in ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) located in the ``docs/decisions/`` directory.
